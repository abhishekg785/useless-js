unused-files
------------

This does only one thing and i.e to get the unused files in your front-end code.

Using webpack --json, to get the files being used, we can identify the files which are not in use.


Steps to Run:
It uses webpack --json to work.

So simply run :

webpack --json | <path-to-my-script>/index.js

by default, it will take the current dir to fetch the source files to work on.

you can even specify path like :

webpack --json | <path-to-my-script>/index.js --src '<path-to-the-dir-to-fetch-the-files-to-work-on'


Note:
This MAY work or MAY NOT work :P
The main reason i created this is due to this thing called 'process' in Node.JS, a very fascinating thing in Node.JS.
